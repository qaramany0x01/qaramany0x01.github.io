Hello folks, 

I am Ahmed Qaramany. This is my first writeup and my first year of learning web security too. I am looking forward to more achievements in the future and this writeup related to CVE-2022-34305, which I have discovered in all versions of Apache Tomcat products.


Also , I would like to add that this finding was during my bug hunting time.
I was working on a target that had a big program at Hackerone. So we can call the company "Target, Inc."
because I don't have permission to mention that program since the bug has not been disclosed.


Recon : 
I believe that we can get some good results from the recon process and I'm a big fan of doing recon, so I started collecting some Juciy domains from Shodan, using this query :


```
ssl:"Target ,inc"
```

But there is a huge number of ips with different ports, so let's add some filters to our query using http.title
You can see all the titles by clicking more and adding the filter you want.

I was just curious about one of the results which is Apache Tomcat was recently released one day ago on this page you can check the date of each ip from here :

So it's very juicy to put your hands on, so our target now is Apache Tomcat.

I came across an IP using the Apache Tomcat default page, and remmembered that i read some writeups talks about Tomcat, but nothing works for me in this case , Also spent some time checking every example in this examples directory.
Looking for bugs like 
SSRF , SQL injection , Authentication Bypass ,XSS , etc ..


fourtnatlly Found nothing !



i tried to open the examples directory which is not recommmended to let this 
Directories and files public after installing this Product
so i came accross a function that you can login to it 
tried login using default Creds by searching at google Found : 



```
tomcat : tomcat 
role1 : role1
both : both 
```



Thanks Google , It worked and Bug reported and awarded 750$ , I Have posted about it in my Linkedin as a Tip for The Community 
you can find me there [@C0NQR0R](https://www.linkedin.com/in/c0nqr0r/)

There is three inputs that you can write and the input will be reflected. On the page source code , two of them are vulnerable to XSS.



```html
"><img src=d onerror=confirm"POC|@C0NQR0R"> 
```


We have the alert popup. Now you just need to target the admin and send the vulnerable link to him.
We can steal his cookies and also you can login again since you are not authenticated but you know the vulnerable input so you can exploit it easy. We can do A lot more stuff with this Reflected Cross Site Scripting. 



So I reported this issue to the Apache Tomcat team and they were so helpful, handled it in a very good way, fast reply  and registered this issue as CVE-2022-34305
